        <p>Hi! I'm Emilee and I am so excited to work with you. I take pride in my work and <em>every project</em> I've ever done I hold close to my heart. When I'm not working, I spend my time coaching dance and cheer, listening to music, attending University of Utah Football games, or spending time with my family.</p>
        <h2>Why did I choose graphic design?</h2>
        <p>I have had a love for graphic design since I was in my early teen years. I was 14 when I discovered <a href= "https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> and that is how I found my eye for designing graphics. At a young age, I enjoyed making pretend logos, posters, advertisements, etc. Pretty much anything I could think of. When I got to high school, I spent hours on certain assignments that required graphics because I wanted them to look perfect. When I graduated I entered college as a Criminal Justice major, which I ended up not loving at all. I changed my major 2 more times until I realized, "I want to LOVE my job. I don't want it to feel like work." And it clicked, every one of my favorite assignments for any class I was in always had something to do with design. So I made the switch and immedietally knew this was the perfect fit for me. I have loved every class and never want to stop learning! </p>
